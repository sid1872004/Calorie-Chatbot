Overview
Essentially, this is a basic chatbot that allows users to record the kinds of food they ate and their total calorie consumption for the day. The system relies on two main technologies:

Nutritionix API: Fetches nutritional information from the user's input for food items.
Google Generative AI: Provides messages and motivation based on the person’s food and calorie intake.
The script offers a conversational method to track calories, prompting users to enter what they ate and responding with calorie data along with encouraging feedback.

Dependencies
requests: Used to interface with the Nutritionix API to fetch food nutrient information.
google-generativeai: Used to generate responses from Google’s Generative AI model, allowing the chatbot to engage in a conversation with the user.
Setup
Install required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install requests google-generativeai  # For asynchronous calls

Script Flow
The chatbot begins by asking the user, "What did you eat today?"
Step 1 - Fetch Calories: The script queries the Nutritionix API for nutritional details based on the user's input.
Response Generation: The Generative AI model then generates a friendly and motivational response, including details about the food items and their calorie counts.
Log: The food items and their calories are logged, with the daily calorie count updated.

Example Interaction
User:
So here we go: Food Calorie Tracker Chatbot, GPT-4. What did you eat today? (type 'exit' to quit): apple, banana

Chatbot Response:
Well done! You’ve already had a healthful snack today!
An apple provides 95 kcal, while a banana has 105 kcal. Keep it up!

Food Log:

apple: 95 kcal
banana: 105 kcal

Notes
The Nutritionix API expects the user to provide a clear food description for accurate calorie tracking.
This chatbot offers a fun and easy way to log daily calories and promotes healthy eating habits.
Future Enhancements
Handle exceptions when the API cannot process certain food requests.
Monitor food targets and provide more personalized, motivational feedback.
Maintain a more detailed food log (e.g., query logs over days/weeks).
